## Automatic Testing  
I decided to employ a certain degree of automated testing during the project in the form of unittest, the python built-in module for writing/testing. The tests can be found in the test_views.py file and are summarised below.  

**Sanity Testing**  
The SanityTest class contains a basic sanity test. It verifies fundamental functionality by testing a simple addition function (add_numbers). This ensures that the most basic operations of the environment are working as expected.  

**Feature Testing**  
The TestPostFeature class performs feature testing for creating posts and adding comments. It tests the functionality of the application's features by sending POST requests to the routes handling post creation (/football-post) and comment addition (/add-comment/football/1). It checks if the correct status code (302, indicating a redirect) is returned, which implies successful execution of these features.  

**Endpoint Testing**  
The TestOverviewRoute and TestSportsRoutes classes are focused on endpoint testing. They test various routes of the application to ensure they are functioning as expected:  

TestOverviewRoute tests the main overview route ('/'), verifying that it returns a 200 status code and contains specific content in the response.  
TestSportsRoutes tests several sports-related routes (/football-post, /formula1-post, /rugby-post). It checks that these routes return a 302 status code and redirect to the login page, indicating that the routes are accessible but require user authentication.

## Manual Testing  

During the manual testing, I tested the sites functionality, usability and responsiveness.  

I have kept the basic functionality of the site the same throughout the entire project. Initially leaning towards a note/review site, moving towards a social media site that allows users to create, edit and delete posts.  

**Overview page**  
During the manual testing phase, I changed the images on the overview.html page. A test user suggested that the images could not be seen clearly and a change would make it a better user experience. Due to this feedback, I transitioned to a bootstrap image carousel, like what is used on individual sports pages.  

**Sports pages**
Similarly to the overview page, during testing, i felt that the individual sports pages were rather static and needed something to add interest. I added the bootstrap carousel to allow users to see multiple images relating to the chosen sport.  

**Profile**  
Another change made while testing the site was the introduction of a 'Bio', 'Favourite team' and 'favourite sport'. I included these to give users a chance for them to input their preference and give them the opportunity to see other users and the sort of fans that the site attracts.  

#### Functionality

**General**

Navbar links - All navbar links work as expected.  
Sign up - Signup works as expected with errors handled as expected.  
Login - Login works as expected.  
Flash messages - All flash messages are correctly implemented, both success and error flash messages are displayed correctly.  
Overview cards - The interactive sports cards work as expected on the overview page.  
Image carousels - The image carousels work as expected on individual sports pages and on the overview page on smaller devices.  

**Sports pages** 

Post function - The post feature works as expected.  
Edit Post - Edit post feature works as expected.  
Delete Post - Delete post works as expected.  
Comment - The comment feature works as expected.  
Delete Comment - The delete comment feature works as expected.  

**Profile**

Edit Bio - The edit bio feature works as expected.  
Edit fav team - The edit fav team works as expected.  
Edit fav sport - The edit fav sport works as expected.  
Save/cancel button - The save and cancel buttons both work as expected.
Social media footer - The social media icons work as expected, responding on hover and opening new tab.  
Delete modal - The delete modal opens as expected and deletes content when clicked.  
Logout - The logout feature works as expected.  

**Usability**  

- As previously mentioned, users felt that different images could have been used on the overview page, I implemented an image carousel on mobile devices.  

**Responsiveness**  

I used the following break points for responsiveness.  

- 450px  
- 768px  
- 992px  
- 1200px

Generic bootstrap breakpoints were also used sporadically throughout the site.  

## Bug Reporting
Throughout the development phase of the site, I came across a variety of different bugs/errors that eventually overcame.  

- When I added the 'Favourite Sport' and 'Favourite Team' to the database, there were issues with migration and i was displayed with a 500 internal server error. To correct this, i reset the database.

- When adding 'Favourite Sport' and 'Favourite Team', I did not include them in my auth.py, so when users were signing up, they were not being added to the database.   

- When deploying to heroku for the first time, I was encountered with a 500 internal server error. This time it was due to trying to connect to a local database rather than my PostgreSQL Heroku database.  

- One issue that i had very early on was conflicting packages/modules to do with flask. To get around this, I used older versions of different modules to deconflict the issue. I have been displayed with the following message multiple times. C:\Users\olly-\Documents\GitHub\suport_MP3\suport\auth.py:19: UserWarning: The 'sha256' password method is deprecated and will be removed in Werkzeug 2.4. Migrate to the 'scrypt' method. Moving forward I would intedn to use the most up to date modules, it was just not possible for me this time.  

- A bug that was noticed during testing was that when posts containing words that contained a lot of characters were posted/commented, they overflowed their div. To correct this, I used the following CSS 'word-break: break-word;'  

- Clicking 'cancel' button on profile page was causing content to save and reveal flash message, I added javascript to handle the toggle reveal/hide.  

- Buttons too small on mobile devices, changed width to 100%.  

- Duplicated usernames were allowed, applied same logic as email to prevent users to sign up with usernames already in the database.  

- Users were being logged in automatically rather than being redirected to the login page, I added code to direct users to the login page.  

- When 'Favourite Team' and 'Favourite Sport' were over the 25 character limit, it caused 500 Internal server error. Added code to handle the error.

- Changed from interactive image cards to image carousel on overview page on smaller screens.
