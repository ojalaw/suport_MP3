## Design  

### Colour Scheme

Initial color scheme is general dark theme for a contemporary look, I have included navy blue and white as accent colours which will also provide good accessibility scores.

### Typography

The font used throughout the site is 'Ubuntu', I have chosen this font because I consider it to be clean and easy to read.  



### Layout

The layout of the Suport website is built using the Bootstrap framework, which provides a responsive grid system that allows the website to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The use of a grid system helps to create a consistent layout on necessary pages of the website, which makes navigation and exploration more intuitive for visitors.  


### Symbology  



### Accessibility

### Wireframes

[Suport Wireframe](README-images/suport-mp3-Wireframe.pdf "Link to Suport wireframe")  
There have been some changes since the wireframe was created. The intial plan for the site was for users to be able to create an account and make posts about sports. The general principle remains the same, I have just added a comment ability to the posts and implemented a user profile that includes the users 'Favourite Sport' and 'Favourite team', they can also add a bio.
