## Design  

### Colour Scheme

Initial color scheme is general Dark theme with Black and Grey used for background colors white predominantly used for text and Red used as an accent colour. I have used this to give the site a modern contemporary feel, the colour scheme is also similar to that of Formula One and has been used for symbolic purposes.
